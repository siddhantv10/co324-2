Please find attached 2 ipython notebook files, 2 code pdfs and 1 report pdf file in this folder. I have not included the datasets in the zip file. If you need to run the ipynb notebooks, you can do that by placing all the datasets inside a folder named 'datasets' in the same directory as that of the notebook and use jupyter to run them.
